To easier to understand, let's check out the example below:

At the following code `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");`, we have:

    - It indicates that the want the following characters `"H,e,l,l,o, W,o,r,l,d,!"` in sequence.
    
- A Class: `Console`

    - The name of the class used in the example.

- A Member Access Operator: `.`

    - It's the dot that separated the class name and the member name.

- A Method: `WriteLine`

    - A method used to write in the console.

- A Statement Operator: `;`

    - The semicolon indicates the compiler that the command is finished.
