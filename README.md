Hi there,ðŸ‘‹!

Welcome to my Csharp Review Concepts Repository!

This repository serves as a reference guide for learn and review some csharp concepts.

## C# Definition

C# is a programming language and could be seen as an abstraction that makes easier for humans to read and write code.

## Compiler

But, the computer itself does not understand these high level codes generated written in c#, they needed a program to translate these codes into something they understand, and the program whose do that is called **compiler**.

Every time you run a c# program, first the code is compiled and only then executed.

In summary, the compiler is the bridge that connects both worlds, the code that humans can understand and the code that computers can understand.
